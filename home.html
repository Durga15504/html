    <center><h1>Peach and Gomma</h1></center>

     <p>The story of Peach and Goma began in 2017 when I created the first "Peach Cat ®" stickers for WeChat. It's a story about a white cat (Peach) and a gray cat (Goma), inspired by my boyfriend and my daily life. Goma is Peach's boyfriend, and they live together, loving each other. Sometimes cuddly, sometimes playful, just like us - and just like so many others in love.</p>
     <p>The Peach and Goma Cats are a series of two cats that are a variation of the Milk and Mocha Bears but are unrelated to them. They both have names, which are "Peach" and "Goma", but their genders are currently unknown. They are also known as the "Brownie and Sugar Cats", Goma is "Brownie" and Peach is "Sugar". The artist behind them is @bujuexiaoxiao. @PeachLovesGoma is the offical Twitter account for these cats. There is a blog and merch site as well.</p>
